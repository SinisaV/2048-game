# 2048 Game with LIBGDX üéÆ

Welcome to the 2048 game built using the LIBGDX game development framework!

## Demo üïπÔ∏è

A live demo of the game is not available currently, but you can clone this repository and run the game locally on your machine.

## Game Dynamics üß©

2048 is a tile-matching game where the player's objective is to reach the 2048 tile by combining numbered tiles on a grid. The game starts with two tiles randomly placed on a 4x4 grid. You can slide the tiles in four directions - up, down, left, or right. When tiles with the same number collide due to a move, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.

## Game Mechanics ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Tile Movement:** Use arrow keys or swipe gestures to move tiles on the grid.
- **Tile Fusion:** Merging tiles with the same number creates a new tile with the sum of their values.
- **Scoring:** Points are scored with each merge; the goal is to reach the 2048 tile.

## Game Elements üß±

- **Tiles:** Numbered tiles (powers of 2) that merge upon colliding in the same direction.
- **Score:** Keep track of your score as you merge tiles.
- **Win/Lose Conditions:** Win by reaching the 2048 tile; lose when the grid fills up with no more possible moves.
